# Limitations and Differences

While Convox Cloud provides the same powerful application deployment capabilities as self-hosted Convox Racks, there are some limitations due to its managed, multi-tenant nature. This guide outlines these limitations and provides alternatives where applicable.

## Infrastructure Access Limitations

### No Direct Kubernetes Access

**Limitation**: You cannot use `kubectl` to directly interact with the underlying Kubernetes cluster.

**Impact**: 
- Cannot apply custom Kubernetes manifests
- Cannot install cluster-level operators or CRDs
- Cannot modify cluster configurations

**Alternatives**:
- Use `convox.yml` for all application configuration
- Request features through Convox support for platform-wide needs
- Consider self-hosted Rack if Kubernetes access is critical

### No SSH Access to Nodes

**Limitation**: Cannot SSH into the underlying EC2 instances or container nodes.

**Impact**:
- Cannot perform system-level debugging
- Cannot install system packages directly
- Cannot modify OS configurations

**Alternatives**:
- Use `convox cloud exec` for container access
- Include debugging tools in your Docker images
- Use comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Limited Shell Access

**Limitation**: Shell access is restricted to your application containers only.

**Available Commands**:
```bash
# Access running container
$ convox cloud exec my-service bash -a myapp -i my-machine

# Run one-off command
$ convox cloud run web "rails console" -a myapp -i my-machine
```

## Configuration Limitations

### Restricted Rack Parameters

Unlike self-hosted Racks, Cloud machines have limited configuration options:

**Not Available**:
- Node instance types (fixed to machine size)
- Network CIDR configuration

- VPC settings
- Autoscaling policies for nodes
- Custom IAM roles

**Available**:
- Machine size (X-Small, Small, Medium, Large)
- Region selection
- Application-level configurations via `convox.yml`

### Fixed Resource Ratios

**Limitation**: CPU to memory ratios are fixed per machine tier.

| Machine | vCPU:RAM Ratio |
|---------|----------------|
| X-Small | 1:2 GB |
| Small | 1:2 GB |
| Medium | 1:2 GB |
| Large | 1:2 GB |

**Impact**: Cannot customize for memory-heavy or CPU-heavy workloads independently.

- Init containers

### Agent Services Not Supported

**Limitation**: Cannot deploy agent-type services that run on every node.

**Impact**:
- Cannot deploy custom monitoring agents
- Cannot run node-level services
- Cannot install custom log collectors

**Alternatives**:
- Use built-in monitoring and logging
- Include agents in your application containers
- Use external SaaS monitoring solutions

## Resource Limitations

### Database Resources

**Limitation**: Only containerized databases are available, no managed RDS option.

**Available Resources**:
- PostgreSQL (containerized)
- MySQL (containerized)
- Redis (containerized)
- Memcached (containerized)

**Not Available**:
- AWS RDS
- ElastiCache
- DocumentDB
- DynamoDB

**Alternatives**:
- Use resource overlays to connect to external databases
- Provision managed databases separately and connect via environment variables

### Storage Limitations

**Limitation**: No persistent volume support or EFS mounting.

**Impact**:
- Data not persisted across deployments
- Cannot share files between services
- Limited to ephemeral container storage

**Alternatives**:
- Use external object storage (S3)
- Store data in databases
- Implement stateless architectures

### No Custom Volume Mounts

**Limitation**: Cannot mount custom volumes or host paths.

**Not Supported**:
```yaml
# This won't work in Cloud
volumes:
  - /host/path:/container/path
```

**Supported**:
- Container's ephemeral storage
- Volume sharing within a single service's containers

## Build Limitations

### Build Environment Restrictions

**Fixed Build Resources**:
- Build CPU: Shared pool (not configurable)
- Build Memory: 4 GB (not configurable)
- Build Timeout: 30 minutes (not configurable)
- Build Disk: 20 GB (not configurable)

**Impact**:
- Large builds may fail due to memory limits
- Cannot customize build performance
- Long builds may timeout

**Alternatives**:
- Optimize Dockerfiles for smaller builds
- Use multi-stage builds
- Pre-build base images

### No Custom Build Nodes

**Limitation**: Cannot provision dedicated or custom build infrastructure.

**Alternatives**:
- Use efficient build practices

   - Implement session storage in Redis

2. **Optimize Resource Usage**
   ```yaml
   services:
     web:
       scale:
         cpu: 250      # Start small
         memory: 512   # Increase as needed
   ```

3. **Use External Services**
   - Databases: Use DBaaS providers
   - Storage: Use S3 or similar
   - Monitoring: Integrate Datadog, New Relic, etc.

4. **Implement at Application Level**
   - Security: Application-level authentication
   - Networking: Service mesh patterns
   - Monitoring: APM libraries
